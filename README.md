# Fi~l~reWalker ~ Fast, Flexible and Fun

FireWalker is first a small, light weight Go package with a small,
intuitive API that is easy to understand and use. But very Powerful!

## Really Fast

Thanks to Go! FireWalker uses _go routines_, _channels_ and other
_concurrency_/_synchronization_ primatives to get these high speeds.

## Flexible Plugin Structure

Again, thanks to Go's _plugin_ pkg, we can easily create a plugin echo
system that accepts plugins to create functionality and business logic
outside of the FireWalker utility.

It will have a few common plugins itself, right out of the box.
